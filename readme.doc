Tack 1:
With no changes being done to the master branch, and with changes being made to the new branches, both merges were considered fast-foward merges because it is catching the master branch up to the changes included in the new branches. With this merge, we are then establishing that moving foward, the master branch should contain all of the info from the branches and hence will be maintained moving foward.

Task 2: conflict
B) A scenario in which there is a merge conflict is when the master branch already currently has a line with written code and an branch that is being merged in also uses up the same line for something else. 

C) Any merges that dont have any similarly used lines between the master branch and an another branch. With this, they should combine smoothly with no issues on whether should line take over another.
